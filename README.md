As a user, \
In order to know how many votes each candidate has received in the North Shropshire by-election in December 2021, \
I want to be able to view a list of individual candidate votes, the political parties that they represent and the percentages of total votes.

As a user, \
So that I can clearly observe performance of each political party in the North Shropshire by-election in December 2021, \
I want to be able to rank the parties/candidates in descending order of votes gained/percentage share of vote.
